## 📖 Overview
   In this project, the electronic structure of a one-dimensional atomic chain is analysed using some tight bound approximations. Each atom in the chain is represented by a point atom with fixed energy E_0 and        hopping parameter ʙ (beta). The density of states (DOS) is computed by grouping the discrete energy eigenvalues into fixed-width energy bins. Several bin widths are examined to illustrate how the DOS evolves.
   For smaller values of number of atoms, I have only computed the DOS for the relatively larger bins only because lowers bins will directly give every eigen value with the same height 1 which would not give          valuable information. Assuming spin degeneracy, the Fermi level is identified at half-filling of the energy spectrum. The plot between the sites of atoms in some arbitrary spacing verses the value of the eigen state at each site is also plotted and shown in this project for some higher number of atoms like 50 and 100 showcasing the lowest-energy state, highest-energy state, highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) which can be examined to illustrate bonding, antibonding, and standing-wave behavior in the chain.
