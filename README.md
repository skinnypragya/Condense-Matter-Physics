# Condense-Matter-Physics
In this project, the electronic structure of a one-dimensional atomic chain is analysed using some tight bound approximations. Each atom in the chain is represented by a point atom with fixed energy E_0 and hopping parameter ʙ (beta). The density of states (DOS) is computed by grouping the discrete energy eigenvalues into fixed-width energy bins.
