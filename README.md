## 📖 Overview
    In this project, the electronic structure of a one-dimensional atomic chain is analysed using some tight bound approximations. Each atom in the chain is represented by a point atom with fixed energy E_0 and        hopping parameter ʙ (beta). The density of states (DOS) is computed by grouping the discrete energy eigenvalues into fixed-width energy bins. Several bin widths are examined to illustrate how the DOS evolves.\\
    For smaller values of number of atoms, I have only computed the DOS for the relatively larger bins only because lowers bins will directly give every eigen value with the same height 1 which would not give          valuable information.
